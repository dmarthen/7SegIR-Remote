# 7SegIR-Remote
Controlling 7 Segment Display with IR Remote using Arduino Uno
Input: IR Remote
Output : 7 Segment Display

The Arduino program is :
1. to read IR signal as digital input. In this case is pin #2 on the Arduino board.
2. to map each integer value of the IR signal into a number key pressed on the remote.
3. to map each associated number into an array of segments to be activated.
4. to write digital output to that array of segments of the 7 segment display
